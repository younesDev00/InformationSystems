| Main Flow                      | 1. The potential customer undergoes questionnaire relating to the destination and holiday package of interest, full name, postcode, preferred language ...etc.<br><br>2. The CMC system saves the information and creates a sale likely score for that customer.<br><br>3. The CMC system will then match the request of the customer to the profile of relationship managers which have attributes to handle the requested travel destination or holiday package. Depending how many relationship managers have similar attributes to the requested interest of the customer they will all be assigning to the task but according to likely score of sale between customer and relationship manager. Relationship managers will range rankings of low/medium/high priority, for better efficiency.<br><br>4. A relationship manager will 'select' the 'list of assigned customers to call'.<br><br>5. The CMC System will display the list of customers from high priority to low priority likely sale score, of the certain relationship manager.<br><br>6. A relationship manager will 'select' on 'enquiry of holiday package menu script' for the highest rank customers only.<br><br>7. holiday package menu script is provider by a CMC staff member then the relationship manager will proceed to call.<br><br>8. The use case ends. |
